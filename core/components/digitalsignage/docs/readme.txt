## DigitalSignage
A different way to communicatie a message towards your target group is through digitalsignage. Do you know those screens at hospitals, schools and town halls which display information like the weather, sales or waiting time? Th√°t's digitalsignage! Its purpose is to serve the target group with short, informative messages. It's mostly used in areas where people have to wait, for example: in front of an elevator, in waiting-rooms or at an entrance.

Sterc (https://www.sterc.com) introduced this MODX Extra, it will be possible to set up a digitalsignage system in your good old MODX installation. It lets you define/manage broadcasts, slides and players. Why should you want this? As a developer, you can offer a whole new product next to your regular websites and applications, which means: a whole new market!

## Installation
1. Install the Extra on your MODX website.
2. Setup the right permissions for the users (digitalsignage and digitalsignage_admin).
3. Setup the right permissions for the digitalsignage context.
4. Make a context switch for the digitalsignage context.

When you get a JSON output in the front-end instead of the broadcast, refresh the URI's and try again.

## Requirements
* MODX version 2.5.0 or newer has to be installed.
